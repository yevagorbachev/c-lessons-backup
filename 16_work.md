# Work on String Assignment
### 10/2
---

Just a few quick things:

 * You should work on the string assignment, which will be due tomorrow (Thursday), here is the github classroom link, which should allow you to work in pairs: https://classroom.github.com/g/wHTqovvo

 * I will be back tomorrow. We'll spend some time going over anything we need to that I've tried to cover over this past month. Take a look at the lessons and assignments, and put together any questions that have come up.

 * I've uploaded solutions to the various exercises I've asked of you. You can find them here: https://github.com/mks65/dwsource
