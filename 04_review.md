# Looking Around
## 9/12

### Administrative Stuff
 * Looks like the github classroom thing worked out ok. I'll be evaluating how it works on my end to see if I like it. If anyone has specific feedback on the experince with github classroom, start (or add to) a thread on the QAF for it. Over the summer I actually had the chance to work with most of the people on the github education team, so I'm in a position to give them actionable feedback. (And yes, when I do get back, I have many, many stickers).

### Code Review
 * Today I'd like you to learn from your classmates, based off of the assignment from yesterday. So follow these steps:
 1. (5 min). Talk to the person you share a table with about your work. If you happen to be solo, join the nearest pair. Bring up the code, compile & run it, talk about anything that came up while you were writing this program.
 2. (10 min). Congeal yourselves into groups of 4 or 5, keeping with your original buddy. You do not need to go over the details of each program, but discuss what problems you solved, and once again go over the major points you all ran into during programming. Take note of any unique approaches, or problems, as well as common stumbling blocks.
 3. (20 min). Go back to your assignment and do some of the following:
    * If you put all your code inside `main` (which is fine), try writting separate functions for each question (or mroe if you see ways to modularize further). Make these functions have return values (not just print out the answer and have a void return type).
    * Look at any conditional or loop satements in your code. Remember back in intro, when you would write something like `if pxcor < 0 = true`? (you know you do), now of course, you look at that and see the obvious redundancy. Now in c, all numbers can be interpreted as boolean values. Try to find ways to leverage this fact to get more work out of your boolean values. (amongst other things, remember that the assignment operator returns a value)
