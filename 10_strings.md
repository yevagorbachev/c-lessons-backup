### Do Now
 * Put the following in a C program, compile & run.
   ```C
   char *s = “hello";
   char s1[10] = “hello”;
   printf("s points to: %p\n", s);
   printf("s1 points to: %p\n", s1);
   printf("address of \"hello\": %p\n", &"hello");
   ```

### Strings in C
 * Strings are character arrays.
 * Everything we went over yesterday with respect to arrays is the same. There is nothing special about the way character arrays work. Becuase strings are so useful, there are a few features of C that make working with them simpler.
 * By __convention__ the last entry in a string character array is the NULL character (either `0`, the number, or `\0`, the character). This is not something that is guranteed, if you want to create a string, you will need to make sure that there is a terminating NULL, if not, a number of string related functions will not work.
 * When you use `""` to make a string _literal_:
   1. A character array large enough to store the string, including a terminating NULL, is created in memory.
   2. The characters of the string are stored in that array, and a terminating NULL is added.
 * String literals are _immutable_.
 * If a string literal is exactly repeated in code, a new character array is not created, instead, the orginal array is used. This means all references to the same immutable string literal refer to the same piece of memory.

### Declaring Strings
 * There are 4 ways to declare strings in C (in eaxch example, the numbers and strings used are randomly chosen, none have special meaning in C).
 1. `char s[256];`
    * Declares a mutable array of 256 bytes.
    * No speciic characters are saved to memory.
    * No guarantee of a NULL character at any position.
 2. `char s[256] = "Imagine"`
    * Creates the immutable string literal `"Imagine"`.
    * Declares a mutable array of 256 bytes.
    * __Copies__ the string `"Imagine"`, including a terminating NULL, into the first 8 bytes of the array `s`.
 3. `char s[] = "Tuesday";`
    * Creates the immutable string literal `"Tuesday"`.
    * Creates an 8 bytes array, large enough for `"Tuesday"` and a terminating NULL for the variable `s`.
    * __Copies__ the string `"Tuesday"`, including a terminating NULL, into the array `s`.
 4. `char *s = "Mankind";`
    * Creates the immutable stirng literal `"Mankind"`.
    * `s` becomes a pointer to that immutable string.
 * It is important to note that in example 4, an array is not created. In that case `s` is just a pointer to the memory location with the immutable string lives. If you want a mutable string, you cannot declare it this way.

### Working With String Variables
 * Everything we've covered about pointers and arrays still holds true, string variables are pointers, either array pointers or normal pointers.
 * It is important to keep track of _variables_ vs. _values_.
   * `char s[10] = "Yankees";`
     * In this example, `s` is an array variable that points to the 10 byte array allocation. `s`.
     * `s` is immutable, it cannot point to any other memory location.
       * `s = "Mets";` __is an error__.
     * The values in the array `s` points to are __not__ immutable. You can change the value of the string at any point.
       * `s[0] = 'M';` is perfectly good.
   * `char *s = "AL East Champions";`
     * Here, `s` is a pointer.
     * As a pointer, you can change the value `s` points to.
       * `s = "The Best";` is valid.
     * Since `s` points to an immutable string literal, you cannot change the value of the string.
       * `s[0] = 'N';` __is an error__.

### String Library Functions
 * `string.h` is a library of functions designed to help working with strings.
 * You can look up standard library functions using the linux __man pages__.
   * `$ man <function>` at a command prompt will bring up the man page for the given function. (i.e. `$ man srand`)
 * Exercises
   * Look up the following string functions:
     * `strcpy`
     * `strcat`
     * `strcmp`
     * `strchr`
     * `strchr`
   * Write a C program that demonstrates the normal usage of each function.
